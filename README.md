# Bulma Light
**Note:** This project is still in early development and isn't ready to be used.

## What is this?
This fork of Bulma is intended to fix some issues I've had in the past.

The #1 goal is to reduce the size of the framework. Yes, you can gzip the file to decrease it. And yes, you can import only the specific parts you need. But in my opinion it would be great to reduce the file size down to be smaller out of the box, with the goal of having be around 100kb (or half the current size of Bulma). Secondly, I also plan to add a large footer, accordion block, and some functions to handle things like opening/closing the nav or modal out of the box.

## Will this look identical to Bulma / include all the original components / have all the same class names?
Not quite. Some parts, especially variations of components, will be removed. For these reasons you may need to write a bit more CSS than you would with Bulma. There may also be some differences in the styling of some components if it feels like they need an update.
